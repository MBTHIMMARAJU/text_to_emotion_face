# Facial Expression Recognition using CNN (FER-2013)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify facial expressions into emotions like **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Surprise**, etc., based on grayscale facial images from the FER-2013 dataset.

## üìÅ Dataset
The model is trained on the [FER-2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) dataset. The dataset contains **48x48** pixel grayscale images labeled with the following emotion classes:

- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Sad
- Surprise
- Neutral
